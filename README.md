# "Automated extraction of handwritten text from images"

Handwriting recognition (HWR), also known as Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. This project seeks to classify an individual handwritten word so that handwritten text can be translated to a digital form. The main approach used to accomplish this task i.e, classifying words directly is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with various architectures to train a model that can accurately classify words.
